# Overview
This is a small experiment where I tested different sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract required tech stacks from IT project descriptions. The experiment runs on Colab's free GPU, aiming to explore how LLMs can extract structured data from unstructured text, with potential applications in building a matching system.

# Overview
This experiment primarily tests the performance of various sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Colabâ€™s free GPU. The goal is to evaluate how well LLMs perform under these constraints, while also exploring their potential for extracting structured data from unstructured IT project descriptions, with future applications in building a matching system.
